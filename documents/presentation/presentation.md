Problem: Manually testing is time consuming:
Technique: unit testing
Advantage: Is testing the code in many different scenarios

Problem: debugging on the microcontroller is slow
Technique: unit testing on PC

Problem: The main loop hangs the simulation
Technique: Refactor the main loop out of the way

Technique: use extern to gain access to internal variables

Technique: use a single mockup .c file, while there are a lot of .h files

Technique: run the uC program on a PC:

Technique: check expected value's with unity

Technique: Make a CLI test program

Technique: run the testprogram in a github action
