# cable-tester
Test a cable by putting power on each pin sequentially, and check at the other side.



# Problem
When a lot of different cables have to be tested, it's not economic to make a custom tester for each one. So a universal tester is needed. 

# Use case: Testing a batch of cables that all should be identical to a known good cable.
The tester needs to recognize a know-good cable, and compare other cables against that known good cable. The indication can be as simple as a green and red LED for pass / fail. Optionally 
# Use case: Sorting cables by pinout.
The user has a pile of cables with unknown pinout. The cables can be all RJ45, but some can be various kind of network cables (different number of wires, crossed over / straight), ISDN, or various custom cables. 
The tester needs to display the measured pinout of the cable. This can be done by a display on the tester itself, or via a serial port with a serial terminal.

# Solution
The tester is trained on a known-good cable, and then it provides a fail/pass indication.

# Features
## Measure a cable. (planned)
## Auto shut down. (planned)
## Auto power up. (planned)
## Compare the measured cable to the reference cable. (planned)
## Store the reference cable in non volatile RAM, and load it again on startup. (planned)
## Show the connections of the measured cable on a display. (planned)
## Show the differences between the measured and the reference cable on a display. (planned)
## Save the measured cable to a file. (planned)
## Load cables from a file. (planned)
## Show the result of the last 100 measurements, to catch intermitted faults (planned)
## Use one microcontroller as master, and connect other microcontrollers as slaves to increase pincount. (planned)
### Use one serial port in a ring structure to give the slaves an address.
Each slave receives a byte, increases the byte by one, and sends it to the next slave. The master then receives a byte containing the number of slaves.
### Use the second serial port to send commands to the slaves, and to receive replys, on one party line. Slaves only respond to commands with their address.
* communication frame: Start of command bit
* address bits
* command (assert output, clear output, get inputs)
* command argument (output number)
#### reply
* Start of reply bit
* address bits
* command
* reply length (bytes)
* measured inputs

## Show the current and the expected pinout on a screen (planned)
## Show the current and expected pinout on a serial console (planned)
